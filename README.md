## Synopsis
This website provides an elegant and straightforward solution to displaying large amounts of genealogical data using an "infinitely-pannable" canvas.  Click-and-drag to pan and scroll to zoom features combined with SVG make the family tree high quality and easy to navigate, all in your web browser.

## Motivation
There are many problems with the traditional practice of maintaining physical pages of family tree templates, some which are:
* They are prone to damage and misplacement.
* They are difficult to copy.
* Exchanging a large amount of information often requires an in-person transaction, which is not always feasible.
* Many pages have to be assembled just to view the entire family tree as one chart.
* Often times it is not possible to connect all of the pages properly since the graph's scale is reset every 4-5 generations to maintain readability.
