        <p>Genealogy has been a passion of mine for many years now, and I have always searched for the most intuitive way to display my family history.  There are many problems with the traditional practice of maintaining physical pages of family tree templates, some of which are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>They are prone to damage (natural deterioration, elements) and misplacement.</li>
            <li>They are difficult to copy, and an editable copy is not obtainable unless created by hand.</li>
            <li>Exchanging a large amount of genealogical information often requires an in-person interaction, which is not always feasible.</li>
            <li>Many pages have to be assembled just to view the entire family tree as one chart.</li>
            <li>Often times it is not possible to connect all of the pages properly since the graph's scale is reset every 4-5 generations to maintain readability.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Taking these problems into consideration, I decided to hack together this webpage to display as much information as possible in a straightforward manner.  It is a work in progress, but I am encouraged by its promise so far.</p>
